Problem Statement : Filing an FIR in India remains a daunting task due to language barriers, lack of awareness, and procedural complexity. Additionally, many individuals struggle to access affordable and verified legal assistance. There is a need for a digital solution that streamlines FIR filing and connects users with accessible legal aid.
Solution:
We will make a web portal to simplify FIR filing in rural and urban areas with multilingual voice-assisted help so that the people from the regions of the country who does not  know the common languages like Hindi/English can access to it and can get the judicial aids as soon as possible. And we will add a legal aid booking system to connect people with verified lawyers for free/low-cost help, so that poor people can also get good lawyers . We will add the details of good lawyers with their phone number ,address and office distance to the web page.
